I am 36 years old.  I fell into a career path in construction and the trades after giving up my opera career after having my first kid.  I have found aspects of the trades to be very interesting, however it takes a toll on the body and the pay ceiling is low.  I'm tired of beating up my body day after day for low pay.  I'm excited to not spend this winter in carharts and steel toed boots.
